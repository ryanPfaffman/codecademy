# Codecademy Python

In this repository, I uploaded a number of projects that were completed using Codecademy's project's instructions. However, some things were altered, and some of the features were pushed further a bit so that I could develop a greater understanding of the newfound concepts in question. I really enjoy attempting to extrapolate on the concepts taught on Codecaemy. Hopefully, spending the time to figure out an effective thought-process combining methods of linear problem-solving, research, and out-of-the-box thinking to use when I am stuck on a particular problem will lead to development of a line of thinking that will enable me to problem-solve successfully.
